Installing MongoDB 3.4.0 on Windows 7 involves a series of steps, including extracting the ZIP file, setting up the MongoDB directories, and configuring the MongoDB service. Below is a step-by-step guide to installing and running MongoDB 3.4.0 on Windows 7:

Step-by-Step Installation Guide
1. Extract the MongoDB ZIP File:
Download the ZIP File: Ensure you have the MongoDB 3.4.0 ZIP file.
Extract the ZIP File: Right-click the ZIP file and select “Extract All…” or use an extraction tool like 7-Zip to extract it to a convenient location, such as C:\MongoDB.
2. Set Up the Directory Structure:
Create Directories:

Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.

Create the necessary directories for MongoDB data and logs:

bash
Copy code
mkdir C:\MongoDB\data\db
mkdir C:\MongoDB\log
Move the Extracted Files:

Navigate to the extracted MongoDB folder and move its contents to C:\MongoDB:

bash
Copy code
move <extracted-folder-path>\* C:\MongoDB\
3. Configure MongoDB:
Create a Configuration File:

Open Notepad or another text editor.

Add the following configuration and save it as mongod.cfg in C:\MongoDB:

yaml
Copy code
systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: "C:\\MongoDB\\log\\mongod.log"
    logAppend: true
storage:
    dbPath: "C:\\MongoDB\\data\\db"
net:
    bindIp: 127.0.0.1
    port: 27017
Ensure the paths use double backslashes (\) as shown above.

4. Add MongoDB to System PATH:
Set Environment Variables:
Right-click on "Computer" or "This PC" and select “Properties.”
Go to “Advanced system settings” and click “Environment Variables.”
Under “System variables,” select the Path variable and click “Edit.”
Add ;C:\MongoDB\bin to the end of the variable value (ensure you use a semicolon to separate it from existing entries).
5. Install MongoDB as a Windows Service (Optional):
Run the following command in Command Prompt with administrative privileges:

bash
Copy code
"C:\MongoDB\bin\mongod.exe" --config "C:\MongoDB\mongod.cfg" --install
This will install MongoDB as a Windows service, which allows it to start automatically.
6. Start the MongoDB Service:
Start the Service Manually:

bash
Copy code
net start MongoDB
To stop the service:

bash
Copy code
net stop MongoDB
7. Run MongoDB Server Manually (If not using as a service):
Open a new Command Prompt window with administrative privileges.

Navigate to MongoDB Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd C:\MongoDB\bin
Start the MongoDB Server:

Connect to MongoDB Shell:

bash
Copy code
mongo
Run the following command to verify the MongoDB version:

javascript
Copy code
db.version()
This should return 3.4.0, indicating that the installation was successful.
